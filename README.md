# Financial Data Analysis

### Project Overview  
In this project I used real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange during the period of 2012-2016. This data, which is available in kaggle.com, contains information of the S&P 500 companies. Three kind of analysis were applied using spreadsheets: 
- The use of summary statistics like mean, median and standard deviation to compare the performance of the companies in terms of financial metrics.
- The creation of an interactive profit and lost statement for each company in every year. 
- The implementation of an interactive forecasting model for 2 years (2017 and 2018).
